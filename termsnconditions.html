            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
            <p><strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong></p>
            <p>By using Campus Connect as a seller, you agree to these terms. We may update these terms from time to time, and by continuing to use the platform, you accept the changes.</p>

            <p><strong>Seller Responsibilities</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Accurate Listings: Provide clear and truthful details about your items, including descriptions and prices.</li>
                <li>Confirmation of Sale: If an item is sold, you must confirm it immediately. Failure to do so will result in a penalty (see Section 5).</li>
                <li>Communication: Respond to buyers promptly to ensure smooth transactions.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Commissions</strong></p>
            <p>Campus Connect takes a percentage from each sale, based on the item price:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>₱1 to ₱500: 2%</li>
                <li>₱501 to ₱1,000: 5%</li>
                <li>₱1,001 to ₱10,000: 8%</li>
                <li>₱10,001 to ₱20,000: 12%</li>
                <li>₱20,001 and above: 15%</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This commission is automatically deducted from your earnings.</p>

            <p><strong>Penalties for Non-Confirmation</strong></p>
            <p>If you do not confirm that an item is sold after a buyer checks out:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will get a warning.</li>
                <li>Half of the transaction amount will be deducted from your wallet.</li>
                <li>The regular commission will still apply.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Wallet and Earnings</strong></p>
